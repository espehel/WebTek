<h1>Espen Hellerud</h1>
<h2>What i do</h2>
<p>
I am currently studying Computer Science at Norwegian University of Science and Technology
I started at my Bachelor degree in autumn 2011, we nearly no earlier experience. The first lectures of
the computer science courses was very overwhelming, but i quickly caught on, and started to enjoy it.
Now i have completed my Bachelor degree, and started on my Master in Artificial Intelligence.

<h2>What is my future plan</h2>
<p>
My current short term plan is to finish my Master degree, here at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
Further I can see myself as a developer in a company focusing on software development. Right now that is most likely
going to be a consulting firm. Reason for that is mostly because that the companies that market themself to our study most.
